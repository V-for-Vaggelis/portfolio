# Portfolio

My portfolio is a personal website built after my graduation from Udacity's "front-end web developer nanodegree program", to showcase all of my work as a front-end developer during my studying time. The website is built with react to achieve an interactive experience for the user.

## How to run

#### Production build (recommended)

Using <a href="https://v-for-vaggelis.github.io/portfolio/">this live page</a> is recommended

#### Development build

navigate in the directory you want to place the app and:

* clone the current repository: `git clone https://github.com/V-for-Vaggelis/portfolio.git`
* navigate in the project's repository `cd Portfolio`
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the hosting server with `npm start`
